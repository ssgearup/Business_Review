# Client Business_Review
1. Executive Summary
To enhance data-driven decision-making, improve reporting efficiency, and provide real-time visibility into key business metrics, we propose the implementation of a centralized Power BI Dashboard.
2. Problem Statement
Currently, business units rely heavily on Excel-based reporting and manual data consolidation, which results in:
-Time-consuming report generation
-High risk of human error
-Delays in decision-making due to outdated data
-Limited ability to explore data interactively
3. Proposed Solution
Deploy a Power BI Dashboard that integrates data from various sources (ERP, CRM, inventory systems, etc.) to provide:
-Interactive visualizations
-Real-time data refresh
-Role-based access to metrics
-Drill-down capabilities to analyze trends and performance drivers.
4. Use Case Examples
-Finance: Track monthly revenue, budget variance, and expenses in real-time
-Sales: Visualize sales pipeline, conversion rates, and regional performance
-Operations: Monitor inventory levels, processing times, and quality metrics
-IT/Disposal/Logistics: KPIs such as device processing time, hazardous waste %, tons incinerated/landfilled, average disposal time
